# **Data Preparation**

---

Every data science endeavor begins with source data that will hopefully provide insights on a question (business, technical, scientific, etc). Each data set will present with its own characteristic data quality issues that must be identified, characterized, and (if problematic) corrected or mitigated.

## **Project Objective**

The objective of this project is to showcase various methods that can be used in data preparation to yield a data set that can be effectively analyzed and, if desired, used to train machine learning models.  

## **Methods**

These Google slides ([LINK to slides PDF](clean/JUST_clean_data_project.pdf)) will step you through the various steps in preparing a challenging dataset for statistical analysis and use in machine learning (shown on a separate project LINK HERE.

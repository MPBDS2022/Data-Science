In other words, should we be trying to sort the reviews into categories based on sentiment or predict the actual rating of the review?\n* What vectorization methods for the reviews are the most efficient and preserve the most data as well as allowing for the most accuracy? \n* Can we somehow find insight into what features or words are most important for predicting review rating?"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"44bc47c0a38c376f075c5b5a9199fe40d3a53dbc"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Drug Ratings Dataset: Preliminary Data Exploration\n\n<br>\nOur ideas for preliminary exploration:\n- Most common conditions\n- Overall best and worst reviewed drugs\n- The curability of each disease\n- Best drugs for each condition\n- Most useful reviews\n- Usefulness vs review score\n- Bias in reviews\n    - Users tend to review things they really liked or really disliked, fewer reviews in the middle\n"},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"79c7e3d0-c299-4dcb-8224-4455121ee9b0","_uuid":"d629ff2d2480ee46fbb7e2d37f6b5fab8052498a","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# ALL imports\nimport numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nfrom matplotlib import style; style.use('ggplot')\nimport nltk\nfrom nltk.sentiment.vader import SentimentIntensityAnalyzer\nimport time\nfrom sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer\nfrom sklearn.metrics import confusion_matrix\nfrom sklearn.naive_bayes import MultinomialNB\nfrom sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"c4c3f5aaa114c845fe8916705fcf8d0774431272"},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Create dataframes train and test\ntrain = pd.read_csv('../input/drugsComTrain_raw.csv')\ntest = pd.read_csv('../input/drugsComTest_raw.csv')","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"8e69e8ba4b303c0104f6c642293a0d862a8811f0"},"cell_type":"code","source":"train.head()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"7be4a324c214a46eb31e76376e925f406ff19793"},"cell_type":"code","source":"test.head()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"ab033a3c6aa136ece8799fd777c094226e2bfbfe"},"cell_type":"code","source":"list(train) == list(test)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"9706eabff95bfa6e25c38ce1cbc70846f0032a56"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Both train and test have the same features.

The obvious starting question for such an approach is how can we convert the raw text of the review into a data representation that can be used by a numerical classifier. To this end, we will use the process of vectorization. By vectorizing the 'review' column, we can allow widely-varying lengths of text to be converted into a numerical format which can be processed by the classifier.\n\nThis is achieved via the TI-IDF method which involves creating tokens (i.e. individual words or groups of words extracted from the text). Once the list of tokens is created, they are assigned an index integer identifier which allows them to be listed. We can then count the number of words in the document and normalize them in such a way that de-emphasizes words that appear frequently (like \"a\", \"the\", etc.). This creates what is known as a bag (multi-set) of words. Such a representation associates a real-valued vector to each review representing the importance of the tokens (words) in the review. This represents the entire corpus of reviews as a large matrix where each row of the matrix represents one of the reviews and each column repreents a token occurence.\n\nTerm-Frequency Inverse Document-Frequency (TF-IDF) is a way of handling the excessive noise due to words such as \"a\", \"the\", \"he\", \"she\", etc. Clearly such common words will appear in many reviews, but do not provide much isight into the sentiment of the text and their high frequency tends to obfuscate words that provide significant insight into sentiment. More details about the method can be found on [wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tf%E2%80%93idf).\n\nThe main limitation of this approach is that it does not take into account the relative position of words within the document. Here we are only using the frequency of occurence.

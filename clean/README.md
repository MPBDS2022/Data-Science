Every data science endeavor begins with source data that will hopefully provide insights on a question (business, technical, scientific, etc). Each data set will present with its own characteristic data quality issues that must be identified, characterized, and (if problematic) corrected or mitigated.

## **Project Objective**

The objective of this project is to showcase various methods that can be used in data preparation to yield a data set that can be effectively analyzed and, if desired, used to train machine learning models.

# Assets

- These Google slides ([slides PDF](clean/JUST_clean_data_project.pdf)) will step you through the various steps in preparing a challenging dataset for statistical analysis and use in machine learning (shown in a [separate project](ML/code/placeholder.ipynb) ).

- View the python notebook for this project [here](/code/data_prep_portfolio_FINAL_4_github.ipynb)

# Data Preparation Methods

- Data Quality Assessment
  - Create DataFrame from CSV data and navigate through the unprocessed data to begin to identify data issues
  - Check for accuracy, completeness, consistency, etc
- Data Pre-Processing
  - Cleaning, transforming, and possibly reducing the complexity of data
    - Correct spelling and naming format issues
    - Drop unnecessary columns
    - Check and fix datatypes for correct format
    - Clean up monetary data to be integers versus heterogenous string+int
    - Check for Missing Data
    - Encode categorical variables
      - Identify categories by looking for unique values
      - Implement a nominal encoding scheme
    - Outliers
- Tech Stack [shown below](#the-tech-stack)

## **Sample outcomes**

Throughout the notebook and slides shared above you will see a progression from raw data to data that has been cleaned and prepared from statistical analysis and machine learning.

Below are a couple screenshots of data before and after the cleaning methods.
